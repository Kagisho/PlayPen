Use event to notify subscibers when the event has taken place.

This declares the event as well as the delegate when the order is saved:
public EventHandler<ForexOrderEventArgs> OnForexOrderSave;

This allows us to notify subscribers of the actual object that has been saved:
ForexOrderEventArgs : EventArgs
